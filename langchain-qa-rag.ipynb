    "\n",
    "**Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. *This usually happens offline.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full sequence from raw data to answer will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexing\n",
    "1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We'll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this.\n",
    "2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won't fit in a model's finite context window.\n",
    "3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retrieval and generation\n",
    "4. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/).\n",
    "5. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat/) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data"
